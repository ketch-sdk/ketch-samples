# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a sample application demonstrating an alternative approach to using Ketch in a React application. In most cases, it is not required and our [Recommended Approach](https://docs.ketch.com/ketch/docs/deploying-ketch-in-react-web-applications#recommended-approach) is sufficient.

Please see our [documentation](https://docs.ketch.com/ketch/docs/deploying-ketch-in-react-web-applications#alternative-approach) on this method before proceeding.

To use your own Ketch organization and property, replace the script tag in [`src/App.tsx`](./src/App.tsx) with the one from the properties screen in your Ketch dashboard.

To run the application, execute the following:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```
