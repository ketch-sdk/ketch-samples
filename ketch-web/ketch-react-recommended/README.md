# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a sample application demonstrating how to use Ketch in a React application. Please see our [documentation](https://docs.ketch.com/ketch/docs/deploying-ketch-in-react-web-applications#recommended-approach) for more details.

To use your own Ketch organization and property, replace the script tag in [`index.html`](./index.html) with the one from the properties screen in your Ketch dashboard.

To run the application, execute the following:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```
