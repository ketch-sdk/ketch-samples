This is an example of using [Ketch](https://www.ketch.com/) in a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can see the Ketch script tag added to the page [here](./src/app/layout.tsx). An optional TCF stub is also added to the page.
