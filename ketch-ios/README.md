# Ketch iOS Samples

- [Using the Ketch Smart Tag within a storyboard based Swift project](./iOS%20Ketch%20Pref%20Center%20using%20Storyboard/)
- [Using the Ketch Smart Tag within a SwiftUI based Swift project](./iOS%20Ketch%20Pref%20Center%20using%20SwiftUI/)

For integration of Ketch Smart Tag to your project its needed to perform following steps:

1. Define Info.plist string for tracking allowance request with key "Privacy - Tracking Usage Description" (NSUserTrackingUsageDescription) that describes wanted purpose, e.g. "Please indicate whether you consent to our collection and use of your data in order to perform the operation(s) youâ€™ve requested."

2. Add html file with privacy web form wrapper to your project. Page located at: /ketch-samples/ketch-ios/index.html

3. Integrate source code of preference settings view controller to your project.
    File for UIKit integration:
    /ketch-samples/ketch-ios/iOS Ketch Pref Center using Storyboard/ConsentViewController.swift
    
    Or view for SwiftUI integration:
    ketch-samples/ketch-ios/iOS Ketch Pref Center using SwiftUI/ConsentView.swift
    
    And add source code for config:
    ketch-samples/ketch-ios/ConsentConfig.swift

 4. Integrate calls for presentation of preference settings view (or view controller):
    Example for UIKit integration:
    ketch-samples/ketch-ios/iOS Ketch Pref Center using Storyboard/iOS Ketch Pref Center using Storyboard/ViewController.swift
    
    Example for SwiftUI integration:
    ketch-samples/ketch-ios/iOS Ketch Pref Center using SwiftUI/iOS Ketch Pref Center using SwiftUI/ContentView.swift
